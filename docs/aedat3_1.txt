AEDAT format
============

DVS data is stored in the AEDAT 3.1 file format as Polarity Events.

For example:

[header] [events] [header] [events] [header] [events] ... [header] [events]

The header format is:

uint16_t eventType
uint16_t eventSource
uint32_t eventSize
uint32_t eventTSOffset
uint32_t eventTSOverflow
uint32_t eventCapacity
uint32_t eventNumber
uint32_t eventValid

An events block contains eventNumber events.

Each event is:

uint32_t data
uint32_t timestamp

uint32_t data contains the x, y coordinates and polarity of the events.
These values can be retrieved with the following binary operations:

x = ( data >> 17 ) & 0x00001FFF
y = ( data >> 2 ) & 0x00001FFF
polarity = ( data >> 1 ) & 0x00000001
